A numpy based program that takes a png or gif and converts the image into one where only a select few colors exist, 
the program finds the allowed color a pixel is closest to and converts the pixel to the new color. 
There is some additional turtle code layered on top to add some animation effects in order to fulfill an interesting class assaignment requirement.
